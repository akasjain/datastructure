 Given a positive integer num, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

 Example 1:
    Input: num = 5
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

 Example 2:
    Input: num = 1
    Output: 0
    Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

 Constraints:
 The given integer num is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
 num >= 1
 You could assume no leading zero bit in the integerâ€™s binary representation.
